## About JETSETGO
The web application JETSETGO is a rather convenient way to establish the communication between pilots and aircraft engineers in order to allocate flights in aseamless way. This application ensures a modern and an efficient way of
communication between pilots and aircraft engineers than the current traditional method
of flight allocation. The web application provide services mainly to pilots and aircraft
engineers within a specific organization/institution. Application is compatible with a
device that has a web browser.

## Aims and Objectives
Main goal of this project is to develop a web application that can allocate flights in a
organised, digital way.

Objectives identified for the development process,
- Create a database table for flight details
-Create a user interface for pilots to interact and select flights.
- Create a user interface for aircraft engineers to update the condition of the flights
and allocate flights for pilots.
- Connect frontend with the backend to get a more stylish GUI.

## Setting Up the Laravel Application Locally
To set up the Laravel application locally, start by cloning the repository to your machine using the provided GitHub URL. Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and run `composer install` to install the required dependencies. Next, create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`, then generate an application key using `php artisan key:generate`. Configure your database settings in the `.env` file and run migrations with `php artisan migrate`. Finally, serve the application locally with `php artisan serve`. Access your Laravel application in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:8000`. Ensure to update the `.env` file with appropriate settings for your environment.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the development and implementation of the flight scheduling application
represent a significant step forward in addressing the challenges faced by the aviation
industry in manual scheduling processes. By leveraging modern technology and best
practices in software development, the application has demonstrated its potential to
improve operational efficiency, enhance collaboration, and ensure safety standards
within the aviation industry. While further enhancements and refinements are necessary
to address identified weaknesses and meet evolving industry requirements, the
application serves as a valuable tool in advancing the efficiency and reliability of flight
scheduling operations. Moving forward, continued investment in technology and
innovation will be essential to drive further improvements and ensure the continued
success of the aviation industry.
